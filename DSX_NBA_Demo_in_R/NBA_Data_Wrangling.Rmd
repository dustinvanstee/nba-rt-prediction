> Have you ever wanted predict outcomes of NBA games in real time as the games are occurring?  This webpage is part 1 or a 2 part series that will describe the methods you can use to build your own prediction model.  We will leverage IBM's Data Science Experience environment with Rstudio to build linear and logistic regression models using R and Spark.  

![datascience.ibm.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dustinvanstee/nba-rt-prediction/master/dsx.png)

As a final step, we deploy an app in IBM's Bluemix using NodeJS.  The site is live and lets you interact with the model that was built using the analysis from the R.

# Inspect Historical score data

> This data is the raw input that contains a record for each update of the game.  Each game has approximately ~120 data points from start to finish.  Games were sampled on 1 minute intervals.
The data has some errors and redundancies that will be removed.  The first step needed is to seperate the in game scores and the final scores.  The final score outcome will end up being the value that will try to be predicted , and therefore must be appended to every in game score.

```{r}
# NAs (not available) are introduced because the raw data has invalid data points, so remove these observations
rtscoresAndFinalDF <- na.omit(nba_scores_DF2)

# Print the dimensions of the data.  Rows are the number of individual score data points.
dim(rtscoresAndFinalDF) #16746     9

# Take a look at the first few rows of the dataframe
head(rtscoresAndFinalDF)

# Final Scores
head(filter(rtscoresAndFinalDF, grepl("FINAL", timestring)))

# Scores from 1st quarter
head(filter(rtscoresAndFinalDF, grepl("1ST", timestring)))

# Custom Feature Explanation

> After building the initial model without custom features, the logistic model was not adjusting the probabilities well at the end of the games. There some examples when there was 0 minutes left in the game, and yet the logistic model was giving a 70% chance of victory for a team. This was due to the fact that the original features were not fitting the end of game very well. To fix this, a custom feature was added that takes the score difference and amplifies it as the score nears the end of the game. This feature dominates at the end of games and helps fit the data at the end of games.

# Score difference as a function of % Complete
```{r, out.width = 'auto'}
# subset a dataframe for scatterplot
# spreader <- filter(rtscoresDF, pct_complete < 95)

# draw interactive scatter plot
scatterD3(x = rtscoresDF$pct_complete, y = rtscoresDF$scoreb_scorea, col_var = rtscoresDF$key, xlab = "% of Game Complete", ylab = "score difference", xlim = c(0,100),  point_size = 10)

# Inspect Odds Data
> How to Interpret the Raw Odds data


    
    Example Golden State -12.5 O (207.0) -125.0 | Detroit 12.5 U (207.0) 145.0
    The away team is listed first, and the home team is second
    Here Golden State is a 12.5 pt favorite to win.  The over under is in parentheses (207) and is the 50/50 line between teams sum of scores
    being above/below that line.  
    Finally the -125 / +145 numbers are whats known at the moneyline odds. 
        A negative number means you need to bet 125$ to get a 100$ payout
        A positive number means you need to bet 100$ to get a 145$ payout

# Filter Out some Data due to data quality
```{r}
# There is an issue with the data I had captured.  When a quarter transitions from 1st->2nd (etc,etc), sometime the timestring doesn't get updated properly.  Since I used the timestring to calculate the timeleft in the game, I would get some rogue data points.  
# Example, after 1 min in a game, something the two teams would have scores in the 20's, because it was really at 11 mins in the second quarter.  
# My solution was to use the final score sum, and then just scale that down to the time left in the game.  I would then compare to the sum of scores i had, and if it was significantly higher, I would remove them.  I did this by visual inspection ... 
# dfa = departure_from_avg
